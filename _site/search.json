This is the amount it needs to collect that year in order to provide services. (This was $6mil in 2021.)\n\n\nLet’s zoom in even further. If you are a property owner in Riverside of a home worth $550K, your taxable value (EAV) is 154k. (how is this calculated).\n\n\n\n\n\nThe total taxable value of all properties in Riverside make up its tax base (Riverside’s tax base is 319 million )\n To divide the cost of services among all property owners, Riverside sets its local tax rate equal to: Levy /Base = Tax rate\n\n\nUsing real numbers, the tax rate equals: \\(\\mathrm{{Levy \\over Base} = Tax \\hspace{0.1cm} rate}\\)"
